I took the liberty of converting some of the midi files to mus format.
Although I wonder if the word liberty is really appropriate here, since two of the midis are mine. :)

d_theda3.mus by AndrewB
d_evil.mus by Hyena
d_read_m.mus by Hyena

I'd also like to point out the mus files by nb_nmare begin with an 'n' instead of 'd' so they won't work in doom.
Not hard to fix.

Thanks,
