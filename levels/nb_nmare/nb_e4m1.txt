New stuff:

- more detail has been added to the four switches area

- a tiny bit of detail has been added elsewhere


To do:

- the southern most corridor still needs a bit more detailing.

- a secret bonus round in the four switches area! This will completely reset it (caco walls go back up, bars raise again, etc), but makes it even harder, with monsters teleporting in as well as the caco's :) There will be a suitable reward at the end though.

- a couple of rooms beyond the blue door.

- the last room is still in a very rough state (as should hopefully be obvious)
