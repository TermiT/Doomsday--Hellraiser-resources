This is a work-in-progress level, strongly inspired by the Ultimate Doom Episode 4 and the Talosian Incident.

The level originally started life as one of the three L.I.N.K. levels, and was started buy Chris Hansen, with some work also done by C. Celizic.

Chris has allowed me to complete the level due to lack of interest in the L.I.N.K. project.
