Release Revision 1.3   Oct 6, 2009

Change:
  Changed the nukeage crossing to use a dry bridge, which was the
  original intention.
  Added a Cacodemon across the street, moved another to a dark corner.
  Added some imps to guard the yellow key room.
  Adjusted some texture alignment over wall screens.
  Fixed the curved stairs so monsters will now ascend.
  Fixed some guard sectors to not block sight lines.
  Changed the starting height of a lift so it is at a floor.
  Raised the ceiling height of some yard sectors.
  Many lighting fixes, darkened outside and made more consistent.
  Adjusted sound blocking.


HAS BEEN DONE:
  Play tested at 1,2,3,4.
  Finished at level 4.
  Verified that can win at level 4 without using the crusher.
  Play tested on Legacy, prboom.
  Not all combinations tested.

Level is large,
  1014 sectors, 6000+ sidedefs.
  If it has to get smaller then I would have to cut
  the elevator, or the curved stairs.

  There are still some places where the corner of a
  building gets clipped, but they have been reduced to
  the point where it is not worth it any more. 

  Some monsters still will not wake up.  It seems that doors act as if
  they are sound blocking, even when not marked.

Play:
  Non-linear, freestyle.
  Can attack in at least 3 different ways,
  by different routes,
  by running wild, sneaking around, or carefully planed.
  Watch your back. I have got shot in the back so
  many times I am getting paranoid.
