MAP29 - Patrick Kalinauskas (Amarande) (avarvae@concentric.net)

Updated version. ZDoom testers reported that the originally uploaded
version of MAP29 had an excessively difficult jump to the teleporter
pad on the green torch platform (out the window from the backpack lift);
also, this version contains deathmatch starts, which were omitted in the
initial upload.
