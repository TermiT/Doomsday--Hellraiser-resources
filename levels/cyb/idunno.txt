Map 25 Changelog (whee, this is necessary!)

Okay now it's done.
---

Should be done now.  Fixed/improved a few teleporters, tweaked monsters a few 
places.  Blah blah blah.

---
Pretty much the final version.  I removed a few monsters, added some ammo and 
health, aligned a few textures and whatnot.  The DM area is also done.

---
Map is now completable in SP play, and essentially done except for some tweaks 
and detailing and play testing a little I assume.  Also added a small DM arena 
which needs detail and to become bigger.  Few more hallways should do it I 
reckon.

---
more areas, and monsters.  Horrah!  You can get the two keys without cheating 
now, but still need clip or kdfa for the yellow door/key.

yeesh.wad, by Cyb (same map, name change thanks to wauthor being a bitch)

More areas added, if you idkfa it's actually possible to exit the map.  With 
idclip you can get the two keys.  That's about it.

cyb@frad.org, heh.  I figured this could maybe replace map25, Bloodfalls, as it 
fits in with the theme sorta (lots of blood, whee).  It's not finished yet, but 
in progress wads are fun, hooray!
