This is the second complete version of E1M7. Please give me some feedback!
If it meets with your approval, it might be the final version. If you have
any gripes, tell me so I can fix whatever the problem might be and upload
it again.

There's a decent amount of monsters, but they're all pretty weak as this is still an E1 level. Health and ammo shouldn't be too much of a problem, depending on how you start the level after playing through E1M1-M6. There's a few helpful secrets along the way, and I designed the level so that it's better to use the chainsaw to conserve ammo in a few places.

Skill settings have been implemented. There's also some DM starts and stuff, but it's basically just a lame spinoff of Dwango5 Map18.

Enjoy!


Note: I fixed some things that NiGHTMARE pointed out.
