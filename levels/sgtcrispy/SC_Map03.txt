Here's my new FreeDoom map 3.
It's not done yet of course, I've got more building, tweaking and texturing to do.

As you can see it's a completely different design than my old map.
Its odd, I've worked on map03 for over a year and never got anywhere near done with itn and then within about 6 hours I got this map, and it's almost done! ARG!
