Description             : An E3M1 replacement for Freedoom (http://www.nongnu.org/freedoom/).
                          Tries to stay somewhat like the original. This map can be played with or 
                          without 
Freedoom resources.

                          Elt.. er, I mean, Fraggle, for Freedoom
