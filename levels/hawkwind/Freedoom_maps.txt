Map 10 - Gave lines 5354 and 5345 a texture, had no textures before which caused HOM.

Removed sector effect from sectors 1017 and ladder and gave it to sector 1018.

Fixed sector 1032 - negative heights.

Map 17 - Too many fixes to mention ! Try it and compare with the current one. It also can now be completed as the old map 17 had no exit !

Map 30 - Just moved sectors 385 ( transporter sector ) and sector 389 onto a 64x64 grid.
