map03_fix.wad

This is a version of Freedoom MAP03 tweaked to fix some errors, including:

1) One unclosed sector
   Sector 68 consisted solely of two one-sided linedefs outside the valid
   playing space to the sides of the doors to the blue key.  It has been
   removed.
2) Moving doortracks
   These were on the following linedefs:
    - 387, 728 (sides of the first door)
    - 466, 472 (door into secret sector 85)
    - 529, 530, 531, 532 (doors to the blue key, which were all /Upper/ Unpegged
                          for some reason)
    - 1054, 1057, 1060, 1063 (doors activated by linedef 1383
    - 2021, 2026, 2054, 2055, 2056, 2057 (sides of the door immediately after
                                          the blue key-locked door; the
                                          DOORTRAKs were /Upper/ Unpegged)
    - 2788, 2789 (sides of the door to a secret switch opened with the gunfire
                  switch; textures changed from DOORSTOP to DOORTRAK)
    - 2797, 2800 (sides of the door to secret sector 485; textures changed from
                  DOORSTOP to DOORTRAK)
3) Inaccessible secret
   The gunfire switch was only accessible if you had a super shotgun, but the
   only super shotgun in the whole map is in the secret accessible only with the
   switch revealed by the gunfire switch.  The gunfire switch has been lowered,
   so that you can now shoot it with any hitscan weapon.
4) Lack of multiplayer
   There were no deathmatch player starts on the map.  I added four of them,
   shotguns and some shells provided for each position, and some doors in this
   spots that could not be opened from their other ends now can.
5) Unmarked locked doors
   There are now better indicators of which keys are needed to open each door.
6) Other odd stuff
    - The door into secret sector 85 was unmarked.  It has now been marked by
      shifting the alignment on its front side two map units down.
    - The big crate near the gunfire switch (sector 234) had CRATE3 on the
      sides, but the sector was raised to the point where the top of the brown
      crate was clearly visible underneath it, sticking out of the floor.  It
      has been altered to CRATELIT, with the texture alignment, flat, and floor
      height changed accordingly.
    - The yellow key-locked door was textured with BIGDOOR2 despite being only
      64 units wide.  It has now been textured with SPCDOOR2 instead.
    - In some places, you climb onto the monitors, which could mess up movement
      around the yellow key.  This is no longer possible.

Hope I didn't miss anything!
