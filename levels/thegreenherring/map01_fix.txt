map01_fix.wad

This is a version of Freedoom MAP01 (E1M1) tweaked to fix some unclosed sectors.
They were:

1) Sector 282
   Linedefs 2106 and 2107 were part of this sector, but outside the valid
   playing space.  They have been removed.
2) Sectors 336 and 359
   Linedef 1436 referenced the wrong sector (sector 359 instead of 336.)  This
   has been fixed as well.

I have also rebuilt the GL nodes with glBSP 2.24.

Enjoy!
