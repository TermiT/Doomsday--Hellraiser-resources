map04_fix.wad

This is a version of Freedoom MAP04 with deathmatch starting positions added.
There are also multiplayer shotguns provided, and three useless ceiling-raising
lines (271, 277, 278; useless because there were no sectors with the same tags
as them in the entire map) have had their actions and tags removed.

Enjoy!
