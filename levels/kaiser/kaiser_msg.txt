Hi,

I noticed in the text file for the level you submitted for freedoom:

(C) December 13, 2001 Samuel Villarreal all rights reserved 

Unfortunately this statement contradicts the freedoom submission 
guidelines:

http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=12868&group_id=61157
(see the "Submitting" section)

Can you just confirm for me that you agree to the submissions guidelines 
and your level is free to redistribute and for other people to modify and 
reuse?

(Sorry if this seems pedantic)
