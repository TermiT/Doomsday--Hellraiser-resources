This is the final version of Map30 for Freedoom.  Beware, because though
this level is legalized, it is more tougher now, and I have set up some traps
which can quickly kill you, so make sure you try to evade those traps somehow.

I also added more secrets, with one which makes one part of the level easier,
helps you find another secret as well.  Two of the secrets are quite hard
to reach, and require some thinking to find them.  The third of the four
secrets can and will help you get an item in the level.

I've also made the Baphomet Room Much Tougher (And totally Different as well),
and very hard to actually inflict damage to the Baphomet now.

I have throughly tested it in Ultra-Violence, so the map can be completed
without trouble.  I'm not sure if the level can be completed on Nightmare
Difficulty, though.

You may want to save often, because there will be a lot of times on
Ultra-Violence in which you may die.

I have also added deathmatch support, but I haven't tested it yet.

UPDATE:  Oops.  A few mistakes in the level involving near the end of the
level.  They are fixed now.
