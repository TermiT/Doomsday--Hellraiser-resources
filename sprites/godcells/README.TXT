**** RED TORCH REPLACEMENT ********

Contains : treda0.bmp tredb0.bmp tredc0.bmp tredd0.bmp

   It's a new submission for the Red torch in Doom2 as well as doom1... I don't like the current one, it look weird 
and do not fit well in the current levels of freedoom so if someone other than me think the same thing and 
wish a replacement, feel free to take those free graphics that I have done and paste 'em into freedoom2.wad.

Enjoy!
