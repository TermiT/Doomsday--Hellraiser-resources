Small font characters for project freedoom,
By Jay Townsend (Jayextee)

They're a little poor actually, but probably better than nothing.
You wouldn't beleive how hard it is to construct recongnisable text
characters at only 7 pixels high.

ESPECIALLY the $%&@* characters. >:(

I've tried them in Doom, and they... 'work'. But that's about it.
They don't look flash or anything, they just do their job.

But, I suppose that's 64 graphics out of the way? ;)
